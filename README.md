 [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09022) | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/collections/MahmoodLab/feather-6875570e0c755f6c9128a85d) | [Cite](#ack)
 
MIL-Lab provides a standardized library for initializing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) models, as well as loading models pretrained on a challenging pan-cancer morphological classification task (*PC-108*, 108-way classification) on a Mass General Brigham (MGB) internal dataset.
This project was developed by the [Mahmood Lab](https://faisal.ai/) at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Brigham. 

### Key Features:

- **Lightweight supervised slide foundation models**: We provide **FEATHER**, *a lightweight supervised slide foundation model* that can easily be finetuned on consumer-grade GPUs, using orders of magnitude less parameters than other self-supervised slide foundation models while achieving competitive performance.
- **Standardized MIL implementation**: Construct numerous MIL methods with a single line of code.
- **Support across encoders**: Load models trained on popular patch foundation models including [UNI](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/UNI), [CONCHv1.5](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/conchv1_5), and [UNIv2](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/UNI2-h).
- **Extensive Benchmarking**: Each model is evaluated on 15+ classification tasks in both morphological and molecular subtyping, with benchmarking against slide foundation models such as [TITAN](https://huggingface.co/MahmoodLab/TITAN), [THREADS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16652), [Prov-GigaPath](https://huggingface.co/prov-gigapath/prov-gigapath), and [CHIEF](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/CHIEF).

### Updates:
- 07/15/25: Feather-24K (CONCHv1.5) has been integrated into [TRIDENT](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TRIDENT).
- 07/15/25: MIL-lab is now live!

### In progress:
- MIL implementations for [MambaMIL](https://github.com/isyangshu/MambaMIL), [SI-MIL](https://github.com/bmi-imaginelab/SI-MIL), [FR-MIL](https://github.com/PhilipChicco/FRMIL), [DGR-MIL](https://github.com/ChongQingNoSubway/DGR-MIL)

## Model weights
We have expanded the PC-108 dataset to span 24K slides from patients treated at MGB (from 3K in the manuscript). ABMIL models pretrained with 108-way classification task on 24K slides, termed *FEATHER-24K* are available for the following patch encoders.

| Model    | Patch enc. | Link            | How to load |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------------| -- |
| **FEATHER-24K**      |   CONCHv1.5    | [HF Link](https://huggingface.co/mahmoodlab/abmil.base.conch_v15.pc108-24k) |`create_model('abmil.base.conch_v15.pc108-24k')` |
| **FEATHER-24K**      |   UNIv2    | [HF Link](https://huggingface.co/mahmoodlab/abmil.base.uni_v2.pc108-24k) | `create_model('abmil.base.uni_v2.pc108-24k')` |
| **FEATHER-24K**      |   UNI    | [HF Link](https://huggingface.co/mahmoodlab/abmil.base.uni.pc108-24k) | `create_model('abmil.base.uni.pc108-24k')` |


## Benchmarking against slide foundation models
FEATHER models offer an efficient pretraining alternative for slide foundation model development, which dominantly relies on self-supervised learning and thus requires intensive data and computational resources. Our benchmarks across 15 tasks (T=15) show they achieve competitive performance to current SOTA slide foundation models, while substantially reducing training time, model size, and pretraining data requirements. 

| Model<br>(Patch enc.) | Avg.<br>(T=15) | TCGA<br>(T=10) | EBRAINS<br>(T=2) | BRACS<br>(T=2) | PANDA<br>(T=1) | Num.<br> Params | Num.<br> Pretrain |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|:---|:---|
| **FEATHER-24K**<br>(CONCHv1.5) | 76.2 | 76.7 | 80.1 | 62.6 | 91.3 | 0.9M | 24K |
| **FEATHER-24K**<br>(UNIv2) | 75.8 | 75.3 | 82.7 | 62.5 | 93.5 | 0.9M | 24K |
| **FEATHER-24K**<br>(UNI) | 75.3 | 75.8 | 81.0 | 57.8 | 93.4 | 0.9M | 24K |
| TITAN<br>(CONCHv1.5) | 75.9 | 76.8 | 83.4 | 59.6 | 91.8 | 48.5M | 336K |
| THREADS<br>(CONCHv1.5) | 74.1 | 72.5 | 78.7 | 61.8 | 91.4 | 11.3M | 47K |
| GigaPath<br>(GigaPath) | 72.6 | 72.6 | 79.3 | 54.6 | 94.5 | 86.3M | 171K |
| CHIEF<br>(CTransPath) | 69.8 | 70.5 | 71.0 | 58.4 | 84.2 | 0.9M | 43K |

All of the models are finetuned according to their official recipes. TCGA task group consists of the molecular subtyping tasks reported in the manuscript.

# 🔨 1. Installation
```shell
conda create -n "mil" python=3.9 -y
conda activate mil
git clone https://github.com/mahmoodlab/MIL-Lab.git
cd MIL-Lab
pip install -e .
pip install git+https://github.com/oval-group/smooth-topk  # Required for CLAM
```


# 🔨 2. **Loading a MIL model**

Models are named as `<model_name>.<config>.<encoder>.<pretrain_task>`, with corresponding weights that can be accessed from HuggingFace after [requesting permission](https://huggingface.co/collections/MahmoodLab/feather-6875570e0c755f6c9128a85d). 

*Pretrained* models can be initialized either with a `state_dict` or with `AutoModel` 
```python
from src.builder import create_model

# construct the model from src and load the state dict from HuggingFace
create_model('abmil.base.uni.pc108-24k', num_classes=5)

# or with HuggingFace's AutoModel using from_pretrained
create_model('abmil.base.uni.pc108-24k', from_pretrained=True, num_classes=5)
```
> [!Note]
> FEATHER models do not include a classification head. Obtain the appropriate output dimension for your needs by specifying `num_classes`
>

To initialize models with *random weights*, use `create_model` or the underlying model architecture implementations as standalone modules. 
```python
create_model('abmil.base.uni.none', num_classes=5)    # directly specify the task as "none"  

# or as a standalone module
from models.abmil import ABMILModel
from models.dsmil import DSMILModel
from models.transmil import TransMILModel

ABMILModel(in_dim=1024, num_classes=2)
DSMILModel(in_dim=1024, num_classes=2)
TransMILModel(in_dim=1024, num_classes=2)
...
```

> [!NOTE]
> Feeling lazy? `create_model` will also use default values if a shorter name is supplied
>
You can provide varying levels of detail in the model name. Default values of `config=base`, `encoder=uni`, `task=none` will be filled in
```python
# the following models are equivalent
create_model('abmil')
create_model('abmil.base')
create_model('abmil.base.uni')
create_model('abmil.base.uni.none')
```
## Model inference
Inference with an MIL model can be performed as follows:

```python
features = torch.randn(1,100,1024)

model = create_model('abmil')
results_dict, log_dict = model(features, 
                               loss_fn=nn.CrossEntropyLoss(), 
                               label=torch.LongTensor([1]), 
                               return_attention=True,
                               return_slide_feats=True
)
```
**Input** 
- Batch of patch features (`torch.Tensor`) of shape `(batch_size, num_patches, feature_dim)`.
- The patch features can be easily extracted with our sister repo [TRIDENT](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TRIDENT).

**Args**
- `loss_fn`: Optional loss function for computing loss based on the model output. Required for models with auxiliary losses.
- `label`: Ground truth label. Required if `loss_fn` is supplied. 
- `return_attention`: If True, returns attention scores indicating patch importance, with different definitions across MIL models.
- `return_slide_feats`: If True, returns slide-level features used for classification head.

**Output** 
- `results_dict`
    - `logits`: Output of the model in shape `(batch_size, num_classes)`
    - `loss`: If `label` and `loss_fn` are supplied, then loss will also be included in the output dict.
- `log_dict`: Contains logits and loss as numpy arrays for easier logging
    - `attention`: Predicted attention scores
    - `slide_feats`: Slide-level features
  
**Additional bits** 
- For models which use auxiliary loss, including CLAM and DFTD, the `label` and `loss_fn` arguments are required. Note that models with augmented loss will return both `loss` indicating a weighted loss between `loss_fn()` and the auxiliary loss. The loss from only `loss_fn` can be accessed via `log_dict['cls_loss']`

# 🔨 3. **Customize MIL-Lab**
Users can flexibly introduce new 1) hyperparameter configurations, 2) encoders, and 3) MIL architectures.
> [!NOTE]
> Contributions are welcome! Feel free to create pull requests with additional MIL implementations. Upon review, we can perform PC-108 pretraining on proposed implementations
> 

## New configurations
To create a new set of hyperparameters for your model, you can directly pass in the hyperparameters into create_model. For instance, apply a dropout of 0.3 with a embedding dimension of 256 

```python
create_model('abmil.base.uni.none', dropout=0.3, embed_dim=256, num_classes=2)
```
Alternatively, you can make a new config by creating a yaml file under `model_configs/{model_name}/{config_name}.yaml` and initialize it using this new `name`
```python
create_model('abmil.name.uni.none')
```

## New encoders
The encoder argument is used to infer the feature dimension, `in_dim`. New encoders can be supported by updating the following dict in `builders/_global_mappings.py`
```python
ENCODER_DIM_MAPPING = {
    'uni': 1024,
    'uni_v2': 1536,
    'ctranspath': 768,
    'conch': 512,
    'conch_v15': 768,
    'gigapath': 1536,
    'resnet50': 1024,
    'virchow': 2560,
    'virchow2': 2560,
    'phikon': 768,
    'phikon2': 1024,
    'hoptimus': 1536,
    'hoptimus1': 1536,
    'musk': 1024
}
```

## New MIL architecture

To add a new MIL architecture, follow the checklist below:
- [ ] Add a model class to `models` which inherits from `mil_template.MIL`
- [ ] Implement the forward functions (`forward_features`, `forward_attention`, `forward_head`, and `forward`)
- [ ] Add a config class inherting from `transformers.PretrainedConfig`
- [ ] Add a new config under `model_configs/{model_name}/base.yaml`
- [ ] Update `MODEL_ENTRYPOINTS` within `builders/_global_mappings.py` with a map between `{model_name}` and new class and config.
